# Optional-adjusted-credit-spread-forecasting

This project analyzes the time series dynamics of option-adjusted credit spreads to uncover patterns and trends. Using data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) accessed via an R package, we employ ARIMA and VAR models to forecast credit spreads. ARIMA demonstrated superior accuracy, achieving less than 5% deviation in forecasting precision.

## Project Files
- **project.qmd**: Contains R code for data analysis, model implementation, and visualization.
- **project.html**: Rendered HTML file that summarizes the analysis and results.

## Key Results
ARIMA outperformed other models, achieving reliable forecast accuracy with less than 5% deviation, providing insights into spread dynamics and future trends.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary R packages installed, including `tidyverse`, `forecast`, and `vars`.
3. Open `project.qmd` in RStudio and run the code, or view results directly in `project.html`.
